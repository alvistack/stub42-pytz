Description: World timezone definitions, modern and historical
 pytz brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows
 accurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4 or
 higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end of
 daylight saving time, which you can read more about in the Python
 Library Reference (datetime.tzinfo).
